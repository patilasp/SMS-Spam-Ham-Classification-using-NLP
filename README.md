# Project Report: SPAM/HAM Classification Using NLP

## Introduction

In our digital age, spam messages have become a common nuisance, cluttering our inboxes and distracting us from important communications. The goal of this project was to develop an effective classifier that can distinguish between spam (unwanted messages) and ham (legitimate messages) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aimed to create a model that accurately identifies spam messages, enhancing the user experience in email and messaging platforms.

## Objectives

Our project had several key objectives:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of labeled messages, including both spam and ham.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert the text data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
4. **Model Training**: Implement various machine learning algorithms to classify the messages.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of the models using appropriate metrics.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection

We began by sourcing a well-known dataset, the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains a balanced mix of spam and ham messages. This dataset is publicly available and provides a solid foundation for our classification task.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Before diving into model training, we needed to clean the data. This involved several steps:

- **Text Normalization**: We converted all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
- **Tokenization**: We split the messages into individual words or tokens.
- **Stop Word Removal**: Common words (like "and," "the," etc.) that do not contribute to meaning were removed.
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: We reduced words to their root forms to minimize variations.

### 3. Feature Extraction

To convert our text data into a numerical format that machine learning models can understand, we used the **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** method. This technique helps us weigh the importance of each word in the context of the entire dataset, allowing our models to focus on the most relevant features.

### 4. Model Training

We implemented several machine learning algorithms to classify the messages, including:

- **Naive Bayes**: A simple yet effective algorithm based on applying Bayes' theorem.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for binary classification.

Each model was trained on the preprocessed training data, and we used cross-validation to ensure robust performance.

### 5. Performance Evaluation

After training, we evaluated the models on a separate test set. We measured performance using several metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified messages.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.


## Discussion

Through this project, we discovered that the choice of preprocessing techniques and feature extraction methods significantly impacts model performance. While traditional machine learning algorithms performed well, we also noted the potential of exploring advanced techniques like deep learning in future work.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our project successfully developed a spam/ham classification system using NLP and machine learning. With high accuracy rates, our models can help filter out unwanted messages, improving the user experience in digital communication. This project not only highlights the power of NLP in solving real-world problems but also opens the door for further research and enhancements in spam detection technologies.
